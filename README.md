# List of different scripts
This repository is to server as an aggregation of simple scripts that I've implemented for different purposes.

The filename script.r shows how you can use R for generating several test files in batch sequence. To run it you should send 7 arguments related with:

GEN_PROC_RABBITS - number of generations until a rabbit can procreate

GEN_PROC_FOXES - number of generations until a fox can procreate

GEN_FOOD_FOXES - number of generations for a fox to die of starvation

N_GEN - number of generates for the simulation

R C - number of Rows and Columns of the array representing the ecosystem.

N_OBJS - number of objects in the initial ecosystem.
